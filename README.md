Macaco stands for **Ma**gic **Ca**rd **Co**llection and is a utility that helps you to digitalize and organize your [Magic: The Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/) collection. Each card in your collection is represented as a single file and is grouped by folders. This allows you to browse, sort, backup and work with your collection using any file manager of your choice.

Macaco can add new cards to your library by simply typing the `set` and the `number` of the card into the side panel. It will then automatically begin to download an image of the card from [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/) and saves it into your library. An alternative approach would be to scan your cards via [Delver Lens](https://www.delverlab.com/), create a backup and import it into your macaco library.
